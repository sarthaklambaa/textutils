# TextUtils

Text Utils is my first React app that provides various text manipulation features to users.

# Description
Text Utils is a simple React.js application that allows you to manipulate text in various ways. You can convert text to uppercase, lowercase, count the number of words, clear the text, and even copy/paste it. The app also provides a text preview along with the number of words and characters.
